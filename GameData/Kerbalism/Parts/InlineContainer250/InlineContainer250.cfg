  title = Big Supply Container
  manufacturer = Tygoo Transport Solutions
  description = After the extravagant excesses of the previous generation of space-grade supply containers, the fiscal department wasn't very happy of funding development of an even bigger one. When one of the clerks complained about the rationale behind 'putting men in space for the sake of it', JPL switched to war-mode and blackmailed all bureaucrats involved into submission. And the project was approved in the earnest.
